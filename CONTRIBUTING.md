# Contributing

This project is open to any and all contribution from the community. This document will outline our suggested processes for making contributions.

## Issues

This project uses Github Issues for:

1. Reporting bugs using the "Bug Report" template.
2. Feature requests using the "Feature Request" template.
3. General discussions or questions about the project.

If you are thinking about contributing a new feature to the project, we'd prefer if you opened a "Feature Request" issue to discuss it with the project maintainers before implementing. This will make the pull request review easier since we will have already discussed all of the requirements.

## Pull Requests

When opening a pull request, be sure to fill out the template and link to any relevant Github Issues. Project maintainers will provide a code review, ideally with two reviewers, before merging.

## All Contributors

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification. When possible, we will track contributors to the project and each component. If we missed adding you to all-contributors, feel free to open a PR adding yourself and we will merge it.

## Code of Conduct

All Issues and Pull Requests should follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
