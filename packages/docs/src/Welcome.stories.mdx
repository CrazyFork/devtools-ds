# üéâ Welcome

Devtools DS is a project for people who love building developer tools.
When you do any front-end development, you inevitably become an expert at navigating the "devtools" or "inspector" panel in your favorite browser.
Browser devtools have become impressive tools capable of displaying, modifying, and debugging every aspect of a web page.

This project is an attempt to make that same powerful debugging experience available to any JS project.
We're building out the UI components, packages, and templates needed to build your own custom "devtools" -- so that you can build a great developer experience for your users.
It's a big project, but we've made some great progress so far!

# üîß Philosophy

With each of the components in this system we focus on:

- Ease of use (API)
- Performance (limiting external dependencies)
- Accessibility (using established UI patterns when possible)

Each of these goals comes before 100% visual accuracy with the existing browser devtools.
If you see anything that can be improved, we'd love to have you contribute!

Devtools DS is built using [Design Systems CLI](https://github.com/intuit/design-systems-cli) and [PostCSS Themed](https://github.com/intuit/postcss-themed) and acts as a showcase for both projects.
Most of the technical architecture for the project is accomplished using those tools.
We recommend checking them out if you are looking to build your own design system!

# üîé Using this Storybook

This [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is our interactive documentation site for the design system.
In the left navigation bar, you'll find links to each of the different components and packages we have built.
In the top bar, you can use some of the "addons" we have available.
The most important one is the "theme" addon, which will have the logo of a browser.
You can use that dropdown menu to change what theme all of the components use.

To find out more about Storybook, [explore the documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction).
